<h2>Convenient GitBash commands</h2>
<p>Below are some basic commands to use</p>
<ul>
  <li>pwd: prints the path to the current working directory to the screen.</li>
  <li>ls: lists out the directories (folders) and files in the current working directory</li>
  <li>ls directory-name: lists out the directories and files in the specified directory.</li>
  <li>cd directory-name: changes the current directory to the one specified.</li>
  <li>cd ..: change current directory up one level to the parent directory.</li>
  <li>cd ~: change the current directory to the home directory (/Users/Guest on Epicodus computers).</li>
  <li>mkdir new-directory-name: creates a new directory (folder) in the current working directory unless otherwise specified.</li>
  <li>touch new-file-name: creates a new, empty file in the current working directory unless otherwise specified.</li>
  <li>mv file-name new-file-name: moves the contents of the first file into the second file, essentially renaming the file. First file is removed.</li>
  <li>cp file-name new-file-name: creates an exact copy of the contents of the first file into the second file. Both files exist.</li>
  <li>rm file-name: deletes the file.</li>
  <li>rm -r directory-name: deletes the directory and all of the files within it. Be very careful with this command.</li>
  <li>cat file-name: prints out the contents of the specified file to the screen.</li>
  <li>cd Desktop change directory to a directory named Desktop (located inside of the current directory)</li>
  <li>cd /Users/Guest change to /Users/Guest directory (which happens to be the home directory on the Epicodus computers)</li>
  <li>cp Documents/hi.txt . copy the file hi.txt from the Documents directory to whatever directory you are currently working in</li>
  <li>mv Documents/hi.txt . move the file hi.txt from the Documents directory to whatever directory you are currently working in</li>
</ul>
<p>Set up configurations</p>
<ul>
  <li>git config user.name "[name]": Sets a SINGLE user name for all commits in one project. The command must be run in the root directory of that project. You should always use a local configuration on Epicodus machines.</li>
  <li>git config user.email "[email address]": Sets a SINGLE user name for all commits in one project. The command must be run in the root directory of that project. You should always use a local configuration on Epicodus machines.</li>
  <li>git config --global user.name "[name]": Sets a SINGLE user name for all commits on a global level. Only do this on your personal machine. You will only need to run this command once.</li>
